# V7: Session Management

ASVS v5 reference — load this file when analysing category V7.

## Requirements

### V7.1 — Session Management Documentation

#### V7.1.1 [L2/L3]
Verify that the user's session inactivity timeout and absolute maximum session lifetime are documented, are appropriate in combination with other controls, and that the documentation includes justification for any deviations from NIST SP 800-63B re-authentication requirements.

#### V7.1.2 [L2/L3]
Verify that the documentation defines how many concurrent (parallel) sessions are allowed for one account as well as the intended behaviors and actions to be taken when the maximum number of active sessions is reached.

#### V7.1.3 [L2/L3]
Verify that all systems that create and manage user sessions as part of a federated identity management ecosystem (such as SSO systems) are documented along with controls to coordinate session lifetimes, termination, and any other conditions that require re-authentication.

### V7.2 — Session Token Generation

#### V7.2.1 [L1/L2/L3]
Verify that the application performs all session token verification using a trusted, backend service.

#### V7.2.2 [L1/L2/L3]
Verify that the application uses either self-contained or reference tokens that are dynamically generated for session management, i.e. not using static API secrets and keys.

#### V7.2.3 [L1/L2/L3]
Verify that if reference tokens are used to represent user sessions, they are unique and generated using a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG) and possess at least 128 bits of entropy.

#### V7.2.4 [L1/L2/L3]
Verify that the application generates a new session token on user authentication, including re-authentication, and terminates the current session token.

### V7.3 — Session Timeout

#### V7.3.1 [L2/L3]
Verify that there is an inactivity timeout such that re-authentication is enforced according to risk analysis and documented security decisions.

#### V7.3.2 [L2/L3]
Verify that there is an absolute maximum session lifetime such that re-authentication is enforced according to risk analysis and documented security decisions.

### V7.4 — Session Termination

#### V7.4.1 [L1/L2/L3]
Verify that when session termination is triggered (such as logout or expiration), the application disallows any further use of the session. For reference tokens or stateful sessions, this means invalidating the session data at the application backend. Applications using self-contained tokens will need a solution such as maintaining a list of terminated tokens, disallowing tokens produced before a per-user date and time or rotating a per-user signing key.

#### V7.4.2 [L1/L2/L3]
Verify that the application terminates all active sessions when a user account is disabled or deleted (such as an employee leaving the company).

#### V7.4.3 [L2/L3]
Verify that the application gives the option to terminate all other active sessions after a successful change or removal of any authentication factor (including password change via reset or recovery and, if present, an MFA settings update).

#### V7.4.4 [L2/L3]
Verify that all pages that require authentication have easy and visible access to logout functionality.

#### V7.4.5 [L2/L3]
Verify that application administrators are able to terminate active sessions for an individual user or for all users.

### V7.5 — Session Re-Authentication

#### V7.5.1 [L2/L3]
Verify that the application requires full re-authentication before allowing modifications to sensitive account attributes which may affect authentication such as email address, phone number, MFA configuration, or other information used in account recovery.

#### V7.5.2 [L2/L3]
Verify that users are able to view and (having authenticated again with at least one factor) terminate any or all currently active sessions.

#### V7.5.3 [L3]
Verify that the application requires further authentication with at least one factor or secondary verification before performing highly sensitive transactions or operations.

### V7.6 — Federated Session Management

#### V7.6.1 [L2/L3]
Verify that session lifetime and termination between Relying Parties (RPs) and Identity Providers (IdPs) behave as documented, requiring re-authentication as necessary such as when the maximum time between IdP authentication events is reached.

#### V7.6.2 [L2/L3]
Verify that creation of a session requires either the user's consent or an explicit action, preventing the creation of new application sessions without user interaction.
